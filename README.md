## Overview

Implementation of DeepConvLSTM model in pytorch and python3.
To train the model open up jupyter notebook under notebooks directory and follow the instructions.

This implementation is based on "Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition" paper avaiable at <http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/115/html>

The original source code has been implemented using Lasange framework which is available at <https://github.com/sussexwearlab/DeepConvLSTM>
